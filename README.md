# SafariURIs
Apple Safari does not ask the user if s/he wants to open an external URI in another app. Chrome and Firefox recognize the danger of this, and prompt the user first. Because there is no questioning, a malicious entity can:
* Control iTunes and Steam music playback
* Open many applications, possibly all at once
* Cause hundreds of error messages to be created

Hopefully Apple will see the danger here, and decide not to trade security for ease-of-use.
